# spotify-to-yaml-action

Export a public Spotify playlist to YAML.

## Set up

To connect your Spotify account to this workflow, set the following [secrets to your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository). You can find these values from the [Spotify API dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard):

- `SpotifyClientID`
- `SpotifyClientSecret`

In your workflow, you can define `playlist-name` as a workflow dispatch input or an action input. If both are set, the workflow dispatch input will take precedence.

## Set up the workflow

To use this action, create a new workflow in `.github/workflows` and modify it as needed:

```yml
name: Save Spotify playlist

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      playlist-name:
        description: Your Spotify playlist name that you want to export.
        type: string

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  spotify-to-yaml:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Save Spotify playlist and thumbnail
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - name: Save the playlist
        uses: library-pals/spotify-to-yaml-action@v9.0.1
        with:
          spotify-username: "katydecorah"
        env:
          SpotifyClientID: ${{ secrets.SpotifyClientID }}
          SpotifyClientSecret: ${{ secrets.SpotifyClientSecret}}
          SpotifyUser: ${{ secrets.SpotifyUser }}
      - name: Save the thumbnail
        run: curl "${{ env.PlaylistImage }}" -o "img/playlists/${{ env.PlaylistImageOutput }}"
      - name: Commit files
        run: |
          git pull
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add -A && git commit -m "ðŸŽµ ${{ env.playlist }}"
          git push
```
